I"<h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Giorgi</h1>

<p>Iâ€™m a strong believer in writing as a tool for learning. I use this blog as a space for me explore ideas and learn new things. If anyone either learns anything from here or enjoys reading a post, thatâ€™s a bonus.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m currently a machine learning engineer at Route where I work on fraud detection. Previously, I was a data science intern at Proofpoint where I worked on phishing detection systems. Even before that I was a data scientist at Pulsar AI where I led the data science efforts behind on the largest ever nation-wide fully data-driven secret santa.</p>

<p>I graduated from the School of Computing at the University of Utah with a joint BS/MS degree where I did specialization in data science. I was also a researcher at the Utah NLP lab.</p>
