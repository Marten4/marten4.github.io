I"8<h1>Hi, I’m Giorgi</h1>

<p>I’m a strong believer in writing as a tool for learning. I use this blog as a space for me explore ideas and learn new things. If anyone either learns anything from here or enjoys reading a post, that’s a bonus.</p>

<p>I’m currently a machine learning engineer at Route.</p>
