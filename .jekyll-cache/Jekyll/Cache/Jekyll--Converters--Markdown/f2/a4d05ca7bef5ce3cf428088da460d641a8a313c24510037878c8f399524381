I"š<p><strong>Who?</strong>
Iâ€™m currently a machine learning engineer at Route where I work on fraud detection. I previously spent time at Proofpoint working on phishing detection systems. Even before that I was a data scientist at Pulsar AI, where I led the data science efforts behind the biggest nation-wide secret santa. I received a joint BS/MS degree from University of Utah, where I was a part of the NLP lab.</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong>
Iâ€™m a strong believer in writing as a tool for learning. I use this blog as a space for me explore ideas and learn new things. If anyone either learns anything from here or enjoys reading a post, thatâ€™s a bonus.</p>
