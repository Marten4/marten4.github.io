I"b<p><strong>Who?</strong>
I’m currently a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://route.com/">Route</a> where I work on fraud detection. I previously spent time at <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us">Proofpoint</a> working on phishing detection systems. Even before that I was a data scientist at <a href="https://pulsar.ai/about.html">Pulsar AI</a>, where I led the data science efforts behind the <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/docs/techreports/2018/pdf/UUCS-18-004.pdf">biggest nation-wide Secret Santa</a>. I received a joint BS/MS degree from University of Utah, where I was a part of the NLP lab.</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong>
I’m a strong believer in writing as a tool for learning. I use this blog as a space for me explore ideas and learn new things. If anyone either learns anything from here or enjoys reading a post, that’s a bonus.</p>
