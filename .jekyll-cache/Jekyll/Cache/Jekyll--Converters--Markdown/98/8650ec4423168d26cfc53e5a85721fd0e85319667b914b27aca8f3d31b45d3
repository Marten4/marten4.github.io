I"Š<p>Iâ€™m currently a machine learning engineer at Route where I work on fraud detection. I previously spent time at Proofpoint working on phishing detection systems.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a strong believer in writing as a tool for learning. I use this blog as a space for me explore ideas and learn new things. If anyone either learns anything from here or enjoys reading a post, thatâ€™s a bonus.</p>
