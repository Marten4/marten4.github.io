I"q<h1>Hi, I’m Giorgi</h1>

<p>I’m a strong believer in writing as a tool for learning. I use this blog as a space for me explore ideas and learn new things. If anyone either learns anything from here or enjoys reading a post, that’s a bonus.</p>

<p>I’m currently a machine learning engineer at Route where I work on fraud detection. Previously, I was a data science intern at Proofpoint where I worked on phishing detection systems. Even before that I was a data scientist at Pulsar AI where I worked on the largest ever nation-wide fully data-driven secret santa.</p>

<p>I graduated from The School of Computing</p>
