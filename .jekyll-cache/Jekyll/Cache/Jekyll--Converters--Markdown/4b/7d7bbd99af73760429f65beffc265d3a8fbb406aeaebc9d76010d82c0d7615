<p>There are many types of neural networks, each having some advantage over others, in this post I want to introduce the simplest form of a neural network, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). MLPs are a powerful method for approximating functions and it’s a relatively simple model to implement.</p>

<p>Before we jump into talking about MLPs, let’s quickly go over linear classifiers. Given training data as pairs <script type="math/tex">(\boldsymbol{x}_i, y_i)</script> where <script type="math/tex">\boldsymbol{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^n</script> are our datapoints (observations) and <script type="math/tex">y_i \in \{0, 1\}</script> are their corresponding class labels. The goal is to learn a vector of weights <script type="math/tex">\boldsymbol{w}</script> and a bias <script type="math/tex">b</script> such that <script type="math/tex">\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x} + b \ge 0</script> if <script type="math/tex">\boldsymbol{x}</script> belongs to the positive class and <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x} + b < 0 %]]></script> otherwise (belongs to negative class). This decision can be written as the following step function:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\text{Prediction} = \begin{cases}
      1 & \boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x} + b \ge 0 \\
      0 &  \text{Otherwise}\\
\end{cases} %]]></script>

<p>In the case of Logistic Regression the decision function is characterized by the sigmoid function <script type="math/tex">\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}</script> where <script type="math/tex">z = \boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x} + b</script></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\text{Prediction} = \begin{cases}
      1 & \sigma(z) \ge \theta \\
      0 &  \text{Otherwise}\\
\end{cases} %]]></script>

<p>Where <script type="math/tex">\theta</script> is usually set to be 0.5.</p>

<p><em>Note: These are actually just a couple of examples of a zoo of functions that people in deep learning literature refer to as Activation functions.</em></p>

<p>If the dataset is linearly separable this is all fine, since we can always learn <script type="math/tex">\boldsymbol{w}</script> and <script type="math/tex">b</script> that separates the data perfectly. We’re good even if the dataset is almost linearly separable, i.e the data points can be separated with a line, barring a few noisy observations.</p>

<p><img src="../images/blobs.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>But what can we do if the dataset is highly non-linear? for example something like this:</p>

<p><img src="../images/circles.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>One thing we could potentially do is to come up with some non-linear transformation function <script type="math/tex">\phi(\boldsymbol{x})</script> such that the data becomes linearly separable. We can then apply that transformation to the original dataset and learn a linear classifier on the transformed dataset.</p>

<p>For example in this case we can see that the data points come from two co-centric circles. We can use this information to come up with a function: <script type="math/tex">\phi(\boldsymbol{x}) = [x_1^2, x_2^2]</script></p>

<p>Now we can learn a vector <script type="math/tex">\boldsymbol{w}</script> and bias <script type="math/tex">b</script> such that <script type="math/tex">\boldsymbol{w}^T\phi(\boldsymbol{x}) + b \ge 0</script> if <script type="math/tex">\boldsymbol{x}</script> is positive and <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\boldsymbol{w}^T\phi(\boldsymbol{x}) + b < 0 %]]></script> otherwise.</p>

<p><img src="../images/circles_transformed_clf.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This works, but what can we do when it’s not obvious what the underlying function is? What if we’re working in high dimensions where we can’t visualize the shape of the dataset? In general it’s hard to come up with these transformation functions.</p>

<p>Here’s another idea, instead of learning one linear classifier let’s try to learn three linear classifiers and then combine them to get something like this:</p>

<p><img src="../images/circles3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We know how to learn a single linear classifier but how can we learn three linear classifiers that can produce a result like this? The naive approach would be to try to learn them independently using different random initializations and hope that they converge to something like what we want. But this approach is doomed from the beginning since each classifier will try to fit the whole data while ignoring what the other classifiers are doing. In other words there will be no cooperation since none of the classifiers will be ‘aware’ of each other. This is the opposite of what we want. We want/need the classifiers to work together.</p>

<p>This is where MLPs come in. A two-layer MLP can actually do both of the aforementioned things. It can learn a non-linear transformation that makes the dataset linearly separable and it can learn multiple linear classifiers that cooperate.</p>

<p><strong>From classifiers to units:</strong></p>

<p>Let’s continue our idea of learning three classifiers: <script type="math/tex">(\boldsymbol{w_1}, b_1), (\boldsymbol{w_2}, b_3)</script> and <script type="math/tex">(\boldsymbol{w_3}, b_3)</script>. For compactness, let’s combine all of the classifiers into a single matrix and all of the biases into a vector.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\boldsymbol{W} = \begin{bmatrix}
           \boldsymbol{w_1} \\
           \boldsymbol{w_2} \\
           \boldsymbol{w_3} \\
         \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
                    w_1^{(1)} & w_1^{(2)}\\
                    w_2^{(1)} & w_2^{(2)}\\
                    w_3^{(1)} & w_3^{(2)}\\
                  \end{bmatrix} \boldsymbol{b} = \begin{bmatrix}
                             b_1 \\
                             b_2 \\
                             b_3 \\
                           \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<!-- Let's continue with our idea of learning three classifiers but instead of looking at them as independent classifiers, let's define them as units into a single layer. Each units 'job' will be to learn to classify some portion of the input space. This will be the first layer of our MLP.

We will also need a way to combine the outputs of each unit into a final classification decision. In order to do this we can define another classifier that will take as input the outputs of all of the units and will output a classification decision.

**First Layer:**

For simpler notation, let's combine $$\boldsymbol{w_1}, \boldsymbol{w_2}$$ and $$\boldsymbol{w_3}$$ into a matrix and call it $$\boldsymbol{W}$$ and combine $$b_1, b_2$$, and $$b_3$$ into a vector and call it $$\boldsymbol{b}$$.

$$\boldsymbol{W} = \begin{bmatrix}
           \boldsymbol{w_1} \\
           \boldsymbol{w_2} \\
           \boldsymbol{w_3} \\
         \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
                    w_1^{(1)} & w_1^{(2)}\\
                    w_2^{(1)} & w_2^{(2)}\\
                    w_3^{(1)} & w_3^{(2)}\\
                  \end{bmatrix} \boldsymbol{b} = \begin{bmatrix}
                             b_1 \\
                             b_2 \\
                             b_3 \\
                           \end{bmatrix}$$ -->

<p>Now we need to get the classification decision from all three classifiers. We might be tempted to use the step function but for technical reasons that will become clear later on, we require the function to be differentiable and since the step function is not, we cannot use it. We could however use the sigmoid.</p>

<p>The classification decision from each of the units can then be obtained by applying <script type="math/tex">\sigma</script> element-wise to each of the three outputs.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sigma(\boldsymbol{Wx} + \boldsymbol{b}) = \begin{bmatrix}
\sigma(\boldsymbol{w_1x} + b_1) \\
\sigma(\boldsymbol{w_2x} + b_2) \\
\sigma(\boldsymbol{w_3x} + b_3) \\
\end{bmatrix}</script>

<p>In the neural network lingo this is a hidden layer with 3 sigmoid units.</p>

<p><strong>Second Layer:</strong></p>

<p>The first layer gives us three outputs but we still need a way to combine them into a final classification decision. For example if the outputs from the layer is <script type="math/tex">[0.7, 0.6, 0.2]</script> what should the classification decision be?</p>

<p>Let’s define another classifier <script type="math/tex">(\boldsymbol{w}_{final}, b_{final})</script> that will take the outputs of the 3 classifiers as input and will produce a final output: <script type="math/tex">\boldsymbol{w}_{final}^T\sigma(\boldsymbol{Wx} + \boldsymbol{b}) + b_{final}</script></p>

<p>And finally in order to get the final classification decision, we apply a sigmoid activation to the result of this as well. Combining all the parts we get that our function is defined as:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\text{MLP}(x) =\sigma(\boldsymbol{w}_{final}^T\sigma(\boldsymbol{Wx} + \boldsymbol{b}) + b_{final})</script>

<p>This one line actually fully defines our 2-layer MLP.</p>

<p>All is left is to define a loss function over the above function and optimize it with respect to <script type="math/tex">\boldsymbol{W}, \boldsymbol{b}, \boldsymbol{w}_{final}, b_{final}</script> using backpropagation. Which I will be talking about in the next post (hopefully).</p>

<p>Here’s the really cool thing, going back to how we started. We said that if we had a transformation function that could make the dataset linearly separable then learning would be easy. Well <script type="math/tex">\phi(\boldsymbol{x}) = \sigma(\boldsymbol{Wx} + \boldsymbol{b})</script> will actually be that transformation that makes the dataset linearly separable. This is what the data looks like after applying that learned function:</p>

<p>Isn’t that neat?</p>
