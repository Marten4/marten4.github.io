I"≤<p>Every classification problem has some ‚Äútrue‚Äù set of features. These features, if given, renders the problem almost entirely solved. Unfortunately, there is no way to directly uncover what these true features are. Instead we use a labeled training set to learn a mapping function from the inputs to the labels. The hope is that by learning the mapping, we would also learn at least some or most of these true features. However, the problem is that, the training set may also contain features that are not part of the true set but do help with the mapping. This most often happens because of artifacts in data collection. I‚Äôll refer to these type of features as pseudo features.</p>
