I"*<p>There are many types of neural networks, each having some advantage over others, in this post I want to introduce the simplest form of a neural network, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). MLPs are a powerful method for approximating functions and itâ€™s a relatively simple model to implement.</p>
