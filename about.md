<!-- **Who?**
I'm currently a machine learning engineer at [Route](https://route.com/) where I work on fraud detection. I previously spent time at [Proofpoint](https://www.proofpoint.com/us) working on phishing detection systems. Even before that I was a data scientist at [Pulsar AI](https://pulsar.ai/about.html), where I led the data science efforts behind the [biggest nation-wide Secret Santa](https://www.cs.utah.edu/docs/techreports/2018/pdf/UUCS-18-004.pdf). I received a joint BS/MS degree from University of Utah, where I was a part of the NLP lab. -->
